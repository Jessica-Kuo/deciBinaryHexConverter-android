# deciBinaryHexConverter-android
Decimal to binary and hex converter for android devices

Requires at least api 26 to run

User inputs a decimal number then presses one of two buttons to convert the value to binary or hexadecimal.
The result is then displayed on a second screen.

Any commits made by "W Kuo" are done by me on my device from the terminal (the device is registered with my father but I use it as well)
